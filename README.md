### Fibonacci Calulator
This project was designed to simulate the behavior of Client / Server communication. The idea was that you would submit the number of Fibonacci counts on the UI and the request would be transferred from the client to the server. The server will then do the calculation and send the result back to the client. The client would then display the result.

This project includes the following:
- Created a client side with Swing
- Basic validation
- Streams and Readers
- Server Sockets
